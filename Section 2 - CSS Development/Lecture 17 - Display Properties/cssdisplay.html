    <h1>We found them.</h1>
    <p>…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Did you dress her up like this? Bring her forward! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! You don't vote for kings.</p>
    <p>Be quiet! Burn her! <strong> I am your king.</strong> <em> A newt?</em> Did you dress her up like this?</p>
    <h2>Well, what do you want?</h2>
    <p>Well, we did do the nose. Well, what do you want? What do you mean? Be quiet! The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Bloody Peasant!</li><li>He hasn't got shit all over him.</li><li>Well, I didn't vote for you.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Bloody Peasant!</h3>
    <p>Be quiet! Why do you think that she is a witch? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</li><li>Burn her anyway!</li><li>Look, my liege!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Look, my liege! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
    <p>Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Well, I didn't vote for you. Well, I didn't vote for you. Be quiet!</p>
    <p>Bring her forward! But you are dressed as one… He hasn't got shit all over him. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Now, look here, my good man.</p>
    <p>Did you dress her up like this? The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</p>
    <p>Why? I have to push the pram a lot. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. A newt? I am your king.</p>
    <p>Why? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
    <p>Where'd you get the coconuts? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. But you are dressed as one… Now, look here, my good man. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.</p>
    <p>…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? But you are dressed as one… …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.</p>
    <p>Shut up! We found them. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
    <p>Why do you think that she is a witch? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.</p>
    <p>You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! And the hat. She's a witch! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
