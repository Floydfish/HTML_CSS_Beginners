<h1>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</h1>
<p>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! A newt?</p>
<p>Well, I got better. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Why do you think that she is a witch? And the hat. She's a witch! <strong> Oh!</strong> <em> Come and see the violence inherent in the system!</em> Help, help, I'm being repressed!</p>
<h2>Well, I didn't vote for you.</h2>
<p>Did you dress her up like this? How do you know she is a witch? I have to push the pram a lot. Where'd you get the coconuts? We found them. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</p>
<ol>
<li>Well, I got better.</li><li>It's only a model.</li><li>On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Shut up! Will you shut up?!</h3>
<p>The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. And the hat. She's a witch! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>

<p>Did you dress her up like this? Well, she turned me into a newt. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!</p>
<p>Bloody Peasant! Burn her! We found them. Be quiet!</p>
<p>The nose? Well, how'd you become king, then? Well, what do you want? A newt?</p>

<p>Shut up! And the hat. She's a witch! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. But you are dressed as one…</p>
<p>Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Who's that then? Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! I dunno. Must be a king. Did you dress her up like this?</p>
<p>The nose? She looks like one. Well, she turned me into a newt. I am your king. Why do you think that she is a witch?</p>

<p>Well, what do you want? Did you dress her up like this? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. She looks like one. Oh, ow!</p>
<p>Well, I didn't vote for you. You don't vote for kings. What do you mean? How do you know she is a witch? A newt?</p>
<p>You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! And the hat. She's a witch! He hasn't got shit all over him. Did you dress her up like this? Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!</p>
