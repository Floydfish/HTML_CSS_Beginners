          <h1>Hey, whatcha watching?</h1>
          <p>Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
          <p><strong>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</strong> <em> For the last time, I don't like lilacs!</em> Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!</p>
          <h2>Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.</h2>
          <p>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p>
          <ol>
          <li>And I'm his friend Jesus.</li><li>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</li><li>It doesn't look so shiny to me.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3>Hey, whatcha watching?</h3>
          <p>Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Noooooo! No! Don't jump!</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Soon enough.</li><li>For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</li><li>Bender?! You stole the atom.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Throw her in the brig. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Also Zoidberg. I wish! It's a nickel.</p>
          <p>What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
          <p>You don't know how to do any of those. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Soon enough. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
          <p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Who are you, my warranty?! Bender, you risked your life to save me! Noooooo! Is that a cooking show? Meh.</p>
          <p>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Then we'll go with that data file!</p>
          <p>Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</p>
          <p>It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p>
          <p>Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>
          <p>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.</p>
          <p>Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Shut up and take my money! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</p>
          <p>Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? A true inspiration for the children. Noooooo! I'm a thing. I'll get my kit!</p>
