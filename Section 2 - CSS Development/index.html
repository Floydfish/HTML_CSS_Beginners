    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <p class="blueboldtext">
      You created a day care for my dad? Meeseeks don't usually have to exist 
      for this long. It's gettin' weeeiiird. Okay, take it easy Rick. T-that's 
      dark. Whoa, spoilers! I'm a whole season behind.
    </p>

    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <p class="largegreentext">
      What are you looking at, <span class="underline blueboldtext">mother 
      fucker</span>! Like nothing shady ever happened
      in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? You 
      know what those guys do in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls
      and dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each other. You know Grandpa 
      goes around and he does his business in public because grandpa isn't 
      shady. Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh 
      yeah you can't. They blew up. If anything happened to you I would kill 
      myself! I love you bad, bobo!
    </p>

    <h3 class="underline">Heading 3</h3>
    <p>
      Puh rum pum pow! I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality you're as 
      dumb as they come. Allahu blehhhh Akbar! Hey, what the fuck, Morty? The 
      train you got me just completely derailed itself. There's blood all over 
      the windows.
